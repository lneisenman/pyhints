Some Comments:

   * The `Model` function in lmfit wraps our peval function and takes care of calculating residuals

   * Instead of providing a list of parameters, we create a set of lmfit ``Parameters``. We can either use the method from Model as shown in line 23 or create our own as in lines 27-30

   * Note that each parameter has a name that can be used to index the ``Parameters`` container and can have properties including ``min`` and ``max``.

   * Another extremely useful feature is the ability to declare a parameter as fixed using the property ``vary=False``

   * As shown on line 35, fitting is performed using the `Model.fit` function. 

   * lmfit Model returns a ModelFit class with methods and attributes to access the fit result

   * Unfortunately, lmfit seems to do less well than directly using scipy.optimize minimizers
